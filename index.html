                                <h3>
                                    Born and raised in Gainesville, FL, I earned a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech, and am currently working on my master's in Robotics at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. <br><br>
                                    My primary areas of interest in robotics are sensing and navigation, and I have experience using ROS and Kalman filtering to perform mobile robot localization. I'm also skilled in system integration, and have specialized as a Systems Integration Engineer at L3Harris for a couple of years. I am working on expanding my focus areas from pure mechanical and electrical to include more software and theory proficiencies. <br><br>
                                    My non-technical hobbies include playing basketball, ukulele, and Virtual Reality games. I'm an avid reader and listener of audiobooks of topics ranging from science/technology, self-improvement, neuroscience, and science-fiction. Lastly, I'm passionate about helping people to learn and to enjoy learning and am actively searching for novel platforms to make education more accessible and enjoyable.<br><br>
                                    If you'd like to contact me, I can be best reached by email.
